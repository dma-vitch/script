Old backups cleaner for yandex.disk

This is some kind of a draft script for cleaning backups uploaded to yandex.disk. Code uses old http libraries for compatibility with old python installations on never-updated production servers.

Just place .py into /usr/local/bin, edit .json and place in into /usr/local/etc. Feel free to make changes.
